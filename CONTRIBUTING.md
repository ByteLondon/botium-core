# Botium Champions

Botium champion is the award we set up to give out as our appreciation to those who are making an impact on our products.

Community is the heart of Botium and our champions are driving the community! We would like to express our gratitude to those nerds by giving out some shiny stuffs and the privilege of being our champion!
 
There are several ways of contribution.
